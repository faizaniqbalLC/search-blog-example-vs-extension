# fds search blog README

This is the README for your extension "fds search blog". This is amazing for reading blogd through vs code by using my provided links in command palette, we recommend including the following sections.

You can search blogs about Javascript , Ecmascript, Es6, ESmodule-System, React, Css, Custom Hooks, and much more.

Later I'll start to make my own blogs. Now I'm using content of one creator Web Dev Simplified.
