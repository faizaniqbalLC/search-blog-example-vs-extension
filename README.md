**Blogs for Javascript** 

`Blogs for Javascript` extension is amazing for reading blog through vs code by using my provided links in command palette, we recommend including the following sections.

You can search blogs about Javascript , Ecmascript, Es6, ESmodule-System-In-NodeJs, React, Css, Custom Hooks, Animations and much more.

Later I'll start to make my own blogs. Now I'm using content of one creator Web Dev Simplified.
